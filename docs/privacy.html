    <h1>Privacy Policy for Open Gallery</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong>November 11th, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Open Gallery is a Chrome extension that lets users save their favorite artworks locally in their browser. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data stays on your device.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, transmit or share any personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>Open Gallery operates entirely on your device. All favorites, settings and other extension data are stored locally in your browser’s storage.</p>

    <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
    <p>Because no data is collected, nothing is sent to our servers or to any third parties. All extension functionality such as saving and loading your favorite artworks happens solely within your browser.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Open Gallery does <strong>not</strong> use analytics, ads, tracking scripts, or third-party services that collect user data.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any user data with anyone. Again, no data ever leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information, Open Gallery is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make changes to how the extension handles data, we will update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the extension after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
