# Open Gallery â€” Browser Extension  

**Open Gallery** is a browser extension that brings inspiration from museums and cultural institutions right to your device.

## Viewer Discretion  

Please note: Open Gallery does not include filters for sensitive or age-restricted content.  
Some artworks may contain imagery not suitable for all audiences.  

The extension does not endorse or represent the views of any institution; all images belong to their respective museums and collections.
