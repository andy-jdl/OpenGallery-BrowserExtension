# Open Gallery — Browser Extension  
**Open Gallery** is a browser extension that brings inspiration from museums and cultural institutions right to your device. Browse, favorite, and explore with art from around the world. One piece at a time.  

## Contributing  
**Museums and developers** alike are warmly welcomed to contribute in one of two ways. 

### 1. Expanding the Collection  
Museums and developers can help grow the Open Gallery collection by contributing new sources or datasets.  
Please see the [backend documentation](https://github.com/andy-jdl/OpenGallery-Backend/tree/main) for details.  

### 2. Enhancing the Browser Extension  
Developers are encouraged to help improve the extension’s features and capabilities.  

You can contribute by:  
- Opening an issue to suggest ideas or report bugs.  
- Forking this repository, creating a new branch for your changes, and submitting a pull request when ready.  

## Viewer Discretion  
Please note: Open Gallery may include images that may not be suitable for all audiences. At this moment there 
is no safe filter.

The extension does not endorse or represent the views of any institution; all images belong to their respective museums and collections.
